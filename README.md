## Project-Overview

This repository contains a project which was given to me by Lexart as part of a test of a fullstack job opportunity. In summary, I had to create a product search engine that connects to Mercado Livre and Buscap√© webpages, using web scrap.</br>
For this project I used Typescript and Node for the backend, Puppeteer and Cheerio for the web scrapping and React for the frontend.</br>
The project is not yet finished, still having a few things to implement and improve.

---

## Prerequisites

For this project to run in your machine, you'll need to have installed:
- npm or another similar package
- Node.js
- MySQL

---

## Installation

First of all, clone this repository using the SSH option with the command:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:pedrohassen/lexart-fullstack-test-software.git
```

Install the dependencies on both backend and frontend directories, using the command:

```sh
npm install
```

---

## Usage

Use this command on both the backend and frontend directories to run the project locally:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The first two dropdowns set, in order, which webpage you're searching for: All, Mercado Livre or Buscap√©. And which category you'll be searching your product from. The searchbar allows you to input the product you're searching for. After you press the Search button, a list of products will appear. You'll see name, image and price of all the products, you'll have the option to press a button which will redirect you to either Mercado Livre or Buscap√©, depending on which web page that product was from in the first place.

---

## Known Issues

- I still need to implement a way for the page not to crash if the search button is pressed while no text is passed on the searchbar.

- I still need to implement a way to save each search into the database, so another search for the same product is faster.

- I still need to perfect the web scrapping: Searching Buscap√© will only get the same image for all the products.

- I still need to style the project.

- I still need to deploy the project on a free server.
